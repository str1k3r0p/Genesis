Genesis - Web-Based Password Generator
Genesis is a modern, web-based password list generator that creates complex and effective wordlists from simple keywords. It brings intelligent mutation and combination logic into your browser, wrapped in a sleek, responsive interface with a "hacker" aesthetic.

Generate highly customized and effective password lists for security testing, brute-force attack simulations, and hash cracking, all without any installation.



Features
Dual Generation Modes:

Automated Mode: For quick and effective password list generation. Simply enter a keyword, and Genesis uses a smart set of default mutations to create a common password list.

Advanced Mode: Unfold the "Advanced Configuration" to get granular control over the generation process, mirroring the power of a command-line tool.

Powerful Mutation Engine:

Character Substitution: Replaces letters with common "leet" substitutes (e.g., a -> @, s -> $).

Case Variation: Generates various upper and lower case combinations.

Number & Year Appending: Adds sequential numbers and a range of years in multiple formats.

Custom Paddings: Appends common or custom padding values (!, 123, !@#) to the beginning or end of passwords.

Keyword Combination: (Advanced) Combine multiple keywords in various orders with custom separators.


Browser-Based & Secure:

No Installation: Runs entirely in your web browser. No need for Python or any dependencies.

Client-Side Only: All processing is done on your machine. Your keywords are never sent to a server.

Safety Cap: Includes a generation limit of 50,000 passwords to prevent browser crashes from overly complex queries, ensuring a smooth experience.

Easy Export:

Download your generated password list as a .txt file with a single click.

How to Use
Enter Your Keyword(s): Start by typing one or more comma-separated keywords into the input field.

Choose Your Mode:

For a quick list: Simply click the "Generate Passwords" button. Genesis will use its default automated settings.

For a custom list: Click on "Advanced Configuration" to expand the options panel. Here you can fine-tune every aspect of the generation process.

Generate & Download:

After clicking "Generate," wait for the process to complete.

The results will appear in the text area, along with a count of the generated passwords.

Click the "Download .txt" button to save your list.
